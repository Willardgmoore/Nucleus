Getting more contributors
==================================================

So you've been through a lot, preparing for and creating your project. But not enough people are applying. Well, we're sorry, Crowdsourcer.io is still young - heck, we don't even know if it's going to take off at all! But that's not to say you can't get people in from outside of Crowdsourcer.io to help you out.

Invites
---------

From your :ref:`mission_control` you can send invites (access through the applications page) to either email addresses or usernames. If you've got friends or know anyone who'd be interested in joining your project, why not drop them an invite? You never know, they could really help get you off the ground.

Widgets
--------

Throughout the Mission Control, you'll find a small alert with information on the widget builder. All you have to do is click on the type you want, chuck in some parameters (if you want - the default parameters will look just fine) and embed them via HTML. Lots of forum signatures, for instance, allow HTML, so you can plonk it in their. Hopefully people will click on it and then join in.

General shouting from rooftops
-------------------------------

Shout, friends, shout. Getting the word out is often tough, but we recommend you avoid spending any money to get it out there (unless you're comfortable with the fact that you'll get no further :ref:`contribution_basics` for spending). Going to forums, message boards, local communities and anywhere else you can find like minded people is generally a good idea. It's normal marketing like any other low budget project.
