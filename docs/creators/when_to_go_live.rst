Before going Live
===================

Congratulations! You've been approved! So now what? Well, things are starting to heat up and it is easy to become carried away and hit that big, blue 'Live' button. But before you do that, perhaps stay your hand and have a read through some of the things here to see if there's anything that might best be done before going live, now that you have full access to the :ref:`mission_control`.

Add project media
-------------------

From your Mission Control, head to *Project* and then click the *Media* tab. From there you can link to videos and images on external sites (for videos we currently only accept YouTube) or upload images to our servers. These will be displayed on your Project page and you can add captions and reorder them and what not.

Add tasks
----------

If you know roughly what might need to be done as soon as you're out of the gate, why not prepare in advance the tasks? From Mission Control you can create (but not accept) new tasks which as soon as you're live, can be accepted by you and your team.

Invite people
---------------

If you know anyone who you think might be interested in joining your project. Drop them an invite. If they're not registered an email will be sent asking them to do so if they wish to join in. You can also use registered members' usernames. If at any time you want to revoke the invitation you can do so.

Accept applications
--------------------

If you're lucky enough to have received some applications then go ahead and accept (after you've reviewed them of course - see :ref:`before_accepting_applications`). They won't be able to access the Mission Control, but at least they'll get a notification once you go live. You can of course jump into the chat application and have speak with them, which is great for introductions and what not. You could even start planning some things whilst you wait for yet more applicants.

When to go Live
===================

That big, blue button is becoming more and more tempting with every passing minute. When do you get to press it? We think it's best that you go live when two parameters are fulfilled

1. You've got more than 5 (but ideally 10) contributors on board
2. All infrastructure (e.g. repositories, accounts, websites) are set up

Once you've done those two, you're all set. Hit that button!

.. warning:: Having only a very few number of contributors in a project can expose it to the risk of collusion. This can cause a disruption to the autonomous nature of Crowdsourcer.io projects.
