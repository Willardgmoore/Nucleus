Before accepting applications
==================================================

CrowdSourcer.io is built on trust. And sadly, as much as we wish it weren't the case, there'll always be people who are less trustworthy than we'd like. Because of this, we've prepared some tips for you to think about when accepting applications to your project.

Read their application carefully
---------------------------------

A good application will have links to their work and will have gone into detail about their past experience. keep an eye out for these types of application as they're normally a good sign.

Review their profile
----------------------

The first thing to check is to see if they've had any experience on CrowdSourcer.io. If they've been in the same position they're applying to, before, then their approval for that position will be shown to you with their application. It still doesn't hurt to go on their profile anyway and see what their approval has been like in other tasks.

Check out their GitHub account or other links
-----------------------------------------------

You're well with in your rights to ask for applicants to put their GitHub profile or a link to some other site, along with their application. If they don't have an account, that's fine, there's other means of judging them. But if they do, definitely go through with it (unless they look dodgy) and check out what they want to show. It can make or break an application.

.. warning:: Make sure you're looking for those red flags. You'll know them when you see them. Once someone is in your project there is no way to remove without an administrator helping out. You can at most, remove their position from them.
